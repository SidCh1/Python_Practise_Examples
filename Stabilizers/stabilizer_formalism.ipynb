    "# What is Stabilizer Formalism and why do I need it? \n",

    "Quantum error correction is an important domain in the universe of quantum computing. There are several quantum error correction codes to mitigate and combat the errors. The **stabilizer formalism** is a framework for the quantum error correction codes, please observe that it is not a new error correction code on its own by rather a new representation to work with. There are also many error correction codes which doesn't fall under the umberalla of stabilizer formalism. We will not discuss those in this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplest example of error correcting code is the repeatition code. Before we dive deep into the stabilizer formalism, let us draw some inspiration by examining the repeation code from a new angle. \n",

    "<!-- The **stabilizer formalism** is a framework used in quantum error correction. It enables the characterization of quantum states using stabilizer groups, which are subgroups of the Pauli group. This notebook demonstrates the stabilizer formalism through examples implemented in Python with PennyLane. -->\n",

    "How is this error detected? Unlike classical case, no-cloning theorem prevents us from measuring the qubits to learn about the error. Before, worrying about how to detect an error, first let us understand what kinds of errors are possible. Observe the fact that the only detectable error is a single bit flip error on any of the qubits, therefore all we need to check is if any ONE of the bits flipped. In order to do this, we can build a circuit which checks if the first and second qubits are same or different and similary if second and third qubits are same or different. Okay how do we build one? Let us use PennyLane! \n",
    "\n",
    "It is divided into 3 steps. First step is to prepare the state, as from above we can use any alpha and beta to create the state but let us use the simplest one, that is using 1/sqrt 2 for both alpha and beta. The code block below demonstrates that\n"
